  * React Router
  * Cloudinary
  * Firebase-admin
  * BCryptJS
  * JSONWebToken
  * Multer
  * DotEnv
  * CORS

### 2. Project Architecture Principles
- Build frontend FIRST, then backend
- Prioritize FUNCTIONALITY over complexity
- Maintain SIMPLICITY in design
- Follow modular development approach

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- Adhere to software engineering best practices:
  * Consistent naming conventions
  * High code maintainability
  * Robust security implementations
  * Optimal performance
  * Scalable architecture
  * Maximum code reusability
  * Comprehensive test coverage
  * Thorough documentation

### 4. Frontend Development Guidelines
- Create RESPONSIVE and USER-FRIENDLY interfaces
- Use professional naming conventions for:
  * Variables
  * Functions
  * Classes
  * Components
  * Files
  * Directories
  * Modules

### 5. User Experience Design
- Implement clear admin and user workflow
- Ensure interfaces are:
  * Highly functional
  * Fully responsive
  * Intuitive and user-friendly
- Use realistic, professional placeholder data
- Design with attention to visual and interaction details

## Version Control Strategy

### Branch Management
1. `main`: Stable production releases
2. `develop`: Active development integration
3. Feature branches: Derived from `develop`

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature: `feature/short-description`
- Bugfix: `bugfix/issue-description`
- Hotfix: `hotfix/urgent-fix`
- Documentation: `docs/update-description`

### Commit Message Format
- Conventional commits structure:
- Commit Types: 
  * `feat`: New features
  * `fix`: Bug corrections
  * `docs`: Documentation updates
  * `style`: Code formatting
  * `refactor`: Code restructuring
  * `test`: Test additions/modifications
  * `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Pull Request Workflow
1. Mandatory test pass
2. Update relevant documentation
3. Mandatory code review
4. Minimum one approval required
5. Squash and merge to `develop`
