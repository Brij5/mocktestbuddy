# Development Log & Strategy\n\n**Last Updated:** 2024-07-26 <!-- Update this date regularly -->\n\n## 1. Current Project Status\n\n*   **Structure:** Codebase organized into distinct areas for the root (Expo mobile app), `client/` (React web app), and `server/` (Node.js backend).\n*   **Docker:** Standardized Docker setup (`client/Dockerfile`, `server/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`) using Node 20-alpine and multi-stage builds.\n*   **Dependencies:** Separated dependencies between root, client, and server `package.json` files.\n*   **Documentation:**\n    *   `README.md` updated with current setup instructions, tech stack, structure overview, and example component structures.\n    *   `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` (in `docs/`) significantly refined with detailed feature specifications, technical requirements, and database schema improvements.\n    *   `CHANGELOG.md` updated to reflect these organizational changes.\n*   **Cleanup:** Redundant files (backups, unused configs) removed.\n\n> **Outcome:** The project is now in a much cleaner state, ready for focused feature development.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Development Philosophy & Approach\n\n*   **Iterative Development:** Build in phases, delivering core functionality first, iterating based on feedback.\n*   **API-First:** Define and implement robust backend APIs (`server/`) before/in parallel with frontend.\n*   **Component-Driven UI:** Develop reusable components (web: `client/`, mobile: root Expo app) for consistency.\n*   **Shared Logic:** Identify opportunities for shared logic (validation, types) between backend & frontends.\n*   **Testing:** Integrate unit, integration, and E2E tests throughout the development lifecycle.\n*   **Collaboration:** Maintain clear communication, effective Git usage, and regular code reviews.\n\n#### Git Branching Strategy (Recommendation)\n*   Use **GitHub Flow** (or a similar simple model):\n    *   `main`: Always deployable. Protected.\n    *   Feature Branches: Create branches off `main` for new features/fixes (e.g., `feat/user-auth`, `fix/scoring-bug`).\n    *   Pull Requests (PRs): Submit PRs to merge feature branches back into `main` after review/testing.\n    *   Avoid direct commits to `main`.\n\n#### Code Review Process (Expectation)\n*   All code merged to `main` must go through a Pull Request.\n*   PRs should have clear descriptions linking to the relevant task/issue.\n*   At least one other team member should review the PR.\n*   Focus reviews on correctness, clarity, consistency, performance, and security.\n*   Automated checks (linting, tests) should pass before merging.\n\n#### Release Planning (Placeholder)\n*   Define versioning strategy (e.g., Semantic Versioning - SemVer).\n*   Establish a process for tagging releases in Git.\n*   Plan for regular releases after completing development phases/sprints.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

\n## 5. Key Considerations & Potential Challenges\n\n*   **UI/UX Consistency:** Between Web (`client/`) and Mobile (Expo). Requires planning component libraries/design systems.\n*   **State Management:** Effectively choosing & implementing solutions across platforms (Web/Mobile), especially for auth state.\n*   **API Design:** Maintaining clean, consistent, and well-documented APIs for consumption by both clients. **Recommendation:** Implement OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation, ideally auto-generated from backend code (e.g., using annotations or tools like `swagger-jsdoc`), to serve as the single source of truth.\n*   **Performance:** Optimizing DB queries (indexing!), API response times, frontend rendering (long tests, large data).\n*   **Real-time Features:** Handling concurrent test sessions reliably (WebSockets? Careful state management?).\n*   **Security:** Diligent implementation of best practices (Input Validation, Auth Checks, Dependency Scanning, OWASP Top 10).\n*   **Testing Strategy:** Defining and maintaining a balanced testing strategy (Unit, Integration, E2E) for Backend & Frontends.\n*   **Expo vs. Web Differences:** Accounting for differences in APIs, navigation, UI paradigms.\n\n---
\n## 6. Immediate Next Steps (Priorities)\n\n1.  **Setup Client Projects:** Ensure `client/` (Vite) and root Expo project are initialized, runnable, with basic navigation/layout.\n2.  **Finalize Core Dependencies:** Decide on UI libraries (Web/Mobile) and State Management libraries.\n3.  **Backend Foundations:** Begin Phase 1: Implement User/Auth models and core Authentication API endpoints.\n4.  **Shared Types (if TS):** Establish mechanism for sharing common type definitions (API shapes).\n5.  **`.env.example`:** Create/verify `server/.env.example` accurately lists all required environment variables.\n\n---\n\n## 7.
